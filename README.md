Both validation algorithms and UI are written from the scratch.
The unobtrusive javaScript method is used to include the functions.

#### Disclaimer:

This is just an implementation, I've probably missed some of the important bits of actual necessary validation. However, it could work as a user-friendly UI response, if coupled with an actual server-side validation.
